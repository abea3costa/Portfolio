My goal is to leverage my skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions and promote business growth. Looking for new opportunities to grow professionally and make meaningful contributions as a Data Analyst. I‚Äôm excited to apply my experience with BI tools and my problem-solving mindset to real-world data challenges. I‚Äôm always seeking new opportunities for personal and professional development, and I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects!

## Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects which showcase my work and skills as a Data Analyst. 

## Python

## GDP (nominal) per Capita

### Overview
This project aims to analyse how different estimates relate to each other. The dataset contains information on UN, World Bank and IMF GDP estimates across different countries/territories in the world.

### Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of 224 records featuring the different GDP estimates and the year these were recorded.
- Source: Kaggle's dataset: [GDP (in USD) Per Capita Income by Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/gdp-in-usd-per-capita-income-by-country/data) 

### Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values using averages and removed outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Calculated average estimates and visualised if there was a positive or negative correlation between them.
- Analysis: Verified how well each continent was represented by counting the number of records (Countries) per continent. Calculated the average IMF Estimate per continent. Calculated the World Bank Estimate by Year and Continent.
- Visualisation: Built correlation matrix between estimates. Created visualisations for the analysis above.

### Visualisations
- Correlation Matrix between estimates

- Continents by IMF Estimate
![Continents by IMF Estimate](https://github.com/abea3costa/Portfolio/blob/main/Images%20GDP%20python%20project/Continents%20by%20IMF%20Estimate.png )
- World Bank Estimates by Year and Continent
![World Bank Estimates by Year and Region](https://github.com/abea3costa/Portfolio/blob/main/Images%20GDP%20python%20project/World%20Bank%20Estimates%20by%20Year%20and%20Region.png)

### Key Findings
- The GDP estimates from the World Bank and the UN showed a strong positive correlation.
- The World Bank and the IMF GDP estimates, as well as the UN and IMF GDP estimates, also show a positive correlation, although not as strong as the one observed between the World Bank and UN estimates.
- Each continent was represented by a comparable sample of approximately 50 country records, with the exception of Oceania‚Äôs sample, which only included 20 country records.
- Europe holds the highest GDP estimates and represents the highest rates of record keeping over the years when compared to other continents which present gaps in GDP estimate data.

### Results & Conclusions
- The analysis recommends that the records be dated and organized by year to prevent the risk of comparing the three distinct GDP estimates from different years.
- To ensure a more accurate and streamlined analysis, certain issues related to data collection need to be addressed. These issues include the substantial amount of missing data and the inadequate recording of the years in which each estimate had been recorded, within the same row.

### Challenges & Limitations
- 11% of the cells in this dataset contained missing values, which is fairly substantial. Although these values were replaced with average estimates, this likely impacted the accuracy of the analysis.


## BMI Calculator in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Overview
This project‚Äôs aim is to create a BMI calculator based on the NHS formula and classification criteria. The BMI calculator is a simple tool that calculates a person's BMI based on their weight and height. The BMI value is then categorized into different ranges (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese and Severely Obese) to give users an indication of their health status.

### Technologies Used:
- Python: The core programming language for the BMI calculation logic.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for an interactive coding experience, making it easy to showcase the program and output.

### Dataset Description
- [BMI Formula Source]( https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-body-mass-index/calculate-bmi-for-adults)
- [BMI classification source]( https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/food-and-nutrition/healthy-eating-and-weight-management/body-mass-index-bmi/)

### Key Features:
- User Input: The program prompts the user to enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- BMI Calculation: The formula used to calculate BMI is:
BMI=(weight/((height*0.01)2))
- BMI Classification: The program outputs the calculated BMI along with a classification based on the value:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Normal weight: 18.5 ‚â§ BMI < 24.9
  - Overweight: 25 ‚â§ BMI < 29.9
  - Obese: 30 ‚â§ BMI < 39.9
  - Severely obese: BMI ‚â• 40

### How to Run the Code
1.	Clone the repository: git clone [Repository](https://github.com/abea3costa/Portfolio)
2.	Navigate to the project directory: cd [BMI Calculator in Python (Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/abea3costa/Portfolio/blob/main/README.md#bmi-calculator-in-python-jupyter-notebook)
3.	Open the Jupyter Notebook: [BMI calculator]( https://github.com/abea3costa/Portfolio/blob/main/BMI%20calculator.ipynb)
4.	Run the notebook and follow the instructions for input.

### Future Work
- Matplotlib: Visualization tools, like creating plots to show BMI categories or trends over time (if extended functionality is implemented).
- Pandas: Can be used for collecting, storing, or analysing data, such as BMI data of multiple users.
